  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>For the past 12 years I’ve worked exclusively in the
    Entertainment Industry both in Los Angeles and in New Orleans.
    <br>
    <br>
    My work experience encompasses a variety of genres and formats: narrative,
    reality, scripted, unscripted, talk shows, build shows, award shows, live
    broadcasts, live to tape, episodic web series, educational series, and some
    commercials.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have extensive work experience with Avid, FCP(both Studio 7 and X),
    and assorted Adobe Creative Cloud products including Premiere, Photoshop,
    After Effects, and Media Encoder.
    <br>
    <br>
    I’ve been fortunate enough to have worked as an Editor, Assistant Editor,
    Live Video Switcher(TD), Live Video Op, Colorist, Post Production Coordinator,
    and Post Production Supervisor over the last dozen years.
    <br>
    <br>
    In several instances, I’ve been asked to wear several hats on the same show.
    This has provided me with a solid understanding of what is required from,
    and how to communicate with everyone in Production, Post Production,
    at an Ad Agency, and at the Network.
